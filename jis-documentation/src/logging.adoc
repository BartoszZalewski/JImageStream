== Where is the logger

There is a protected field in `Filter` class called `logger` which lets us collect information
about what is happening in Filter subclasses. Currently it is configured to print out logs
straight into the console, so it can be used instead of usual print methods.

== How to use it
The result of this line looks as follows (if it is put in `SaltAndPepperFilter` class): +

I hope the pattern is self-explanatory.

== Levels of logs
In the previous example, the log level used is called _INFO_. Currently the logger is set to display levels: +
_DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR_ and _FATAL_. +
You can still use logs of level _TRACE_ yet those will not be shown in the output at the moment.
